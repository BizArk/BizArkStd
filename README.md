# BizArkStd
A .Net standard version of BizArk

This project is no longer maintained. Please see the [BizArk3](https://github.com/BizArk/BizArk3) project for the a .Net Standard 2.0 library.

This project was a test project to see what features would be lost by switching to .Net Standard. Due to losing so many features with the earlier version of .Net Standard, this project was released on its own. However, .Net Standard 2.0 seems to have enough features now that we no longer need to maintain a seperate project to support it.
